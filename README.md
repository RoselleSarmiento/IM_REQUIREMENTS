# Chapter 2 PRIME NUMBERS

# LESSON OVERVIEW

  Prime numbers, the building blocks of integers have been studied extensively over the centuries. Being able to present an integer uniquely as product of primes is the main reason behind the whole theory of numbers  and behind the interesting results in this theory. Many interesting theorems, applications and conjectures have been formulated based on the properties of prime numbers. In this chapter, we present methods to determine whether a number is prime or composite using ancient Greek method invented by Erastosthenes. We also show that there are infinitely many prime numbers. We then proceed to show that every integer can be written uniquely as a product of primes. We introduce as well the concept of diophantine equations where integer solutions from given equations are determined using the greatest common divisor. We then mention the prime number theorem without giving a proof of course in addition to other conjectures and major results related to prime numbers.
  
  # 2.1: The Seive of Erastothenes
  The seive of erastothenes  is an ancient method of finding prime numbers up to a specified integer. This method was invented by the ancient greek mathematician Erastothenes. There are several methods used to determine whether a number is prime composite.
  
  # 2.2: The Infinitude of Primes
  We now show that there are infinitely many primes. There are several ways to prove this result. An alternative proof to the one presented here is given as an exercise. The proof we will provide was presented by Euclid in his book the  Elements. 

  # 2.3: The Fundamental theorem of Arithmetic
  The fundamental theorem of arithmetic is one of the most important result in this chapter. It simply says that every positive integer can be written uniquely as a product of primes. The unique factorization is needed to establish much of what comes later. There are systems where unique factorization fails to hold. Many of these examples come from algebraic number theory. We can actually list an easy example where unique factorization fails.

 # 2.4: Least Common Factor
  We can use prime factorization to find the smallest common multiple of two positive integers.

 # 2.5 Linear Diophantine Equations
  In this section, we discuss equations in two variables called Diophantine equations. These kinds of equations require integer solutions. The goal of this section is to present the set of points that determine the solution to this kind equation. Geometrically speaking, that diophantine equation represent the equation of a straight line. We need to find the points whose coordinates are integers and though which the straight line passes.

 # 2.6 The Function (x). The Symbols "0" "o" and "~"
  We start this section by introducing an important number theoretic functions. We proceed in defining some convenient symbols that will be used in connection with the growth and behavior of some functions that will be defined in later chapters.

 # 2.7: Theorems and Conjectures involving prime numbers
  We have proved that there are infinitely many primes. We have also proved that there are arbitrary large gaps between prime. The question that arise naturally here is the following: can we estimates how many primes are there less than a given number? The theorem that answers thius question is the prime number theorem.

  # LESSON CONTENT THE SEIVE OF ERASTOTHENES
    A prime number is an integer greater than 1 that is only visible by 1 and itself. The integers 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 are prime integers. Note that any integer greater than 1 that is not prime is said to be a composite number.
    The seive of Eratosthenes is an ancient method of finding prime numbers up to a specified integer. This method was invented by the ancient Greek mathematician Eratosthenes. There are several other method to used to determine whether a number is prime composite. We first present a lemma that will be needed in proof of several theorems.
    Every integer greater than one has a prime divisor. We present the proof of this lemma by contradiction. Suppose that there is a greater that one no prime divisor. Since the set of integers with elements greater than one with no prime divisors is non empty, then by the well ordering principle there is a least positive integer n greater than one that has no prime divisors. Thus n is composite since n divides n. Hence,
                        n= ab with 1 \lt a \lt n and 1 \lt b \lt n.
    Notice that a < n and as a result since n is minimal, a must have prime divisor which will also be a divisor of n, if n is composite integer, then n has a prime factor not exceeding $\sqrt n $. Since n is composite, then n = ab, where a and b are integers with $1 \lt a \le b \lt n$.
